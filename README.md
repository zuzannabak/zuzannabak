# Hi, I'm Zuzanna 👋

I'm a Computational Data Science graduate student at Temple University. I like working at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and data engineering — especially when it involves reasoning about trade-offs, building clean data pipelines, or understanding how information spreads in networks.

Right now I'm involved in an autism-focused ML study and building out several personal projects that help me practice modeling, experimentation, and graph data work.

Here are a few things I've been building:

- **Cost–Utility Calculator (CUCal)** — a tool that models how labeling effort, GPU compute, and accuracy interact during NLP fine-tuning  
  👉 https://github.com/zuzannabak/cost-utility-calculator

- **NCAA Baseball Knowledge Graph** — scraping + cleaning NCAA rosters and mapping them into a Neo4j graph for exploration  
  👉 https://github.com/zuzannabak/ncaa-baseball-kg

- **Healthy-Lifestyle Network Diffusion** — analyzing how behaviors spread across Reddit communities using graph features and logistic models  
  👉 https://github.com/zuzannabak/health-neighbor-analysis

I’ve also worked on smaller projects in Python, R, Django, and AWS — everything from an image-processing web app to statistical analysis for my undergraduate thesis.

**Tech I use:** Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, SQL, Neo4j/Cypher, Streamlit, Git/GitHub, R, LaTeX.  
I'm also comfortable with experiment design, model validation, and building reproducible workflows.
