# Hi, I'm Zuzanna 👋

Graduate student in **Computational Data Science (M.S.) at Temple University**, with a background in **Quantitative Economics** and hands-on experience in **machine learning, data analysis, graph databases, and computational modeling**.

I enjoy solving problems that blend **statistical reasoning, optimization, and data engineering** — whether it’s modeling cost–utility trade-offs in NLP, building large-scale knowledge graphs, or analyzing network diffusion in online communities.
